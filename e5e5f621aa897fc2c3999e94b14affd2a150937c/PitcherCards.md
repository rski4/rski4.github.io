> These cards should be used to compare each member of the Coe pitching staff to their most similar MLB pitchers, by pitch. Each name can be clicked to take you to the MLB pitcher's Baseball Savant (Statcast) page. Pay attention to and manipulate the K-zones for each pitcher to examine how they utilize each pitch (i.e. hits, whiffs, count, batter handedness), while also exploring their pitch tracking statistics to gauge their success. At the bottom of the MLB pitcher's Statcast page, you can also see their pitch velocity distribution, in which we usually want to see as little overlap as possible.

### Jeff Anders
Arsenal: 4-Seam, Slider, Changeup

MLB Comparables:

* Fastball (Cutter)
  + [Mark Melancon](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/mark-melancon-453343?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb){:target="_blank} 
  
* Slider
  + [Shawn Kelley](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/shawn-kelley-518875?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - similar motion without as late of hand separation. Both have good back leg load, but you get better pelvic tilt. However, you don't want to replicate his fastball results - .492 xwOBA. 
  
  + [David Hale](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/david-hale-571735?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - similarly doesn't bring ball below waist in delivery and also has slower acceleration at peak leg lift. 
  
Mechanical Keys:

* Really good pelvic load
* Late hand separation (I think this adds to deception)
  + The ball quickly goes from glove to behind head
* The key is to get arm up consistantly with quick arm action
  + Vertical release point will be key metric 
* Hip-to-shoulder separation is pretty good - could be even better
* Contract left bicep more on release, allow front side to clear
* Momentum is all towards the plate and is leveraged well on release

### Quintin Berglund
Arsenal: 4-Seam, Curveball, Changeup

MLB Comparables:

* Fastball
  + [Tyler Glasnow](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/tyler-glasnow-607192?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb)  - Up in the zone to set up curve

  + [Brad Keller](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/brad-keller-641745?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - Very similar mechanics, not as successful as Glasnow. 
  
* Curveball
  + [Tyler Glasnow](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/tyler-glasnow-607192?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - 30% usage, top 10 whiff/swing%, 73% groundball% - Glasnow able to drop it in for a strike or use down and out of the zone as a wipeout pitch. Excellent command and control of it. 
  
  + [Griffin Canning](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/griffin-canning-656288?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - Canning separates his hands early. Command not as sharp as Glasnow, but he still has the movement to be able to confidently drop it in for a strike when behind. Used more against lefties with slider for righties
  
  + [Pablo Lopez](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/pablo-lopez-641154?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - 2 strikes for RHH, get-me-over/1 strike pitch for LHH
  
Mechanical Keys:

* Good pelvic load
* Good lead with front hip down the mound
* Good shoulder tilt
* Hip to shoulder separation isn't terrible, but need more
* Snap glove through on release - contract left bicep
  + This will help scap-load
* Extend!

### Jared Gordon
Arsenal: 2-Seam, Slider, Changeup

MLB Comparables:

* Fastball
  + [Mike Leake](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/mike-leake-502190?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - Entire motion is very similar. The difference is that Leake throws at more of a 3/4 arm slot. You are trying to bring your body back upright to throw more over-the-top after sinking cheat forward on leg lift. I would say either your arm slot needs to reflect Leake's, or you need to eliminate your chest leaking down and towards third base as your front leg comes. There is too much wasted energy. \
\

Leake was forced to go to his cutter and slurve in 2019; his fastball was hit hard. He also did not have enough speed differentiation between different pitches. As shown below, there is way too much overlap.

  + [Kyle Hendricks](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/kyle-hendricks-543294?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - Hendricks has the similar chest posture, but doesn't rely on velocity at all. He makes his money with his changeup (.241 xBA) and his curveball (.217 xBA). He uses the fastball up in the zone when ahead to set up breaking pitches. You can see the much better arsenal. 

![**Kyle Hendricks - 2019 Arsenal**](Hendricks2019.png)

\
A high 70s, low 80s fastball has to be paired with a consistent mid-high 60s breaking ball and low 70s changeup. Establishing this kind of velocity differentiation that Hendricks utilizes will improve effectiveness. 

Mechanical Keys:

* Need to create more of a pelvic load and shoulder tilt
  + Combine coil with more of a vertical load into back hip
* Fight to keep shoulders back to get separation with hips - creating scap load
* Separate hands closer to a 45 degree angle
* Arm stays up
* Contract left bicep at release - tuck in glove
* Pretty good job of leveraging energy at landing, just need to create more force before you land

### Jacob Jones
Arsenal: 2-Seam, 4-Seam, Slider, Changeup

MLB Comparables: (From Fall Bullpens and Scrimmages)

* Fastball
  + [Tanner Roark](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/tanner-roark-543699?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - Similar mechanics, Roark has been durable through his career. He is at his best when he uses 2-seam/Sinker in on righties and lets it run away from lefties. 4-seamer used up in the zone. Both thrown 91-93 mph. He gets hit hard when his 2-seamer runs into barrels over the middle of the plate. He had strike zone command issues. Confidence has to be there to start 2-seamer to righties middle-in, over the plate - trust the movement.
  
  + [Jimmy Cordero](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/jimmy-cordero-622772?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - Cordero get into his back leg really well and creates great separation. Big body (6'4", 222 lbs) and strength with elite flexibility = how to sit 97-99 mph.\
  \

His Statcast page shows him using his cutter and sinker off of each other with changeup as his wipeout pitch. His slider is inconsistent. The image below shows how his cutter (brown) and his sinker (orange) are used together. The pink dots represent the commit point for hitters - 167 ms or .167 seconds from the plate. You can see how close they are at this point and their differences in where they end up.  
  
  ![**Jimmy Cordero - 2019 Arsenal**](Cordero2019.png)
* Slider
  + [Richard Rodriguez](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/richard-rodriguez-593144?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - .123 xBA in 2019 against his slider. Almost identical mechanics - high leg kick, inward turn - plant leg straightens at hand separation - big scap load - solid hip to shoulder separation and momentum leverage on landing. Rodriguez could also improve shoulder tilt.  

Mechanical Keys:

* Good hip to shoulder separation 
* Good scap load
* Improve shoulder tilt - creating even more momentum towards the plate
* Good leverage over front leg
* Pretty good job of glove tuck - left bicep contraction, can be improved.

### Tyler Riebhoff
MLB Comparables:

* Fastball
  + [Michael Wacha](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/michael-wacha-608379?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) (Cutter) - Wacha's cutter got hit hard by righties, but was effective against lefties, running it in on their hands. 

  + [Ian Kennedy](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/ian-kennedy-453178?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) (Cutter) - Kennedy was more successful than Wacha with his cutter with better command - he was able to get it to end up out of the zoen, away from barrels.\
\
Kennedy drops his hands, similar to you, as his front leg comes through.

* Curveball
  + [Asher Wojciechowski](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/asher-wojciechowski-592879?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - He utilizes both a curve and a slider with good speed differential. .224 xBA in 2019.
  
Mechanical Keys:

* Need better pelvic load and shoulder tilt
  + Glove is kind of "scooped" forward. You could try keeping glove hand up until front foot lands
* More hip to shoulder separation 
* Contract left bicep, tuck glove upon front foot landing
* There's a lot of noise with your glove prior to landing
* Need better energy leverage on landing
* You're on the top of your push off foot at release, which can make you more prone to leaking too far forward, letting your front knee get over your front foot. Your shin angle is almost at 90 degrees.

### Jacob Schmit
Arsenal: 2-Seam, Slider, Changeup

MLB Comparables:

* Fastball
  + [Nick Pivetta](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/nick-pivetta-601713?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - His FB got hit hard in 2019. Poor command, a lot of meatballs. Ranked 500th out of 588 in barrel%. Pivetta doesn't get great separtaion at major league standards.
  
  + [Frankie Montas](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/frankie-montas-593423?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - Feet also finish even occationally, slower back leg. Similar wind-up. Montas creates really impressive hip to shoulder separation with a similar body type. He runs his 2-seam/sinker in to righties and away from lefties.
  
  + [Chris Paddack](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/chris-paddack-663978?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - Paddack is has really good control, but his fastball command issues are where he gets in trouble when he does. He has a very similar delivery, but he does a better job with leveraging momentum and finishing. 
  
Mechanical Keys: 

* Good shoulder & hip tilt
* More hip to shoulder separation
* Try to lead down the mound with front hip a little more
* Extend - come through hard with back leg - don't try to abruptly stop momentum
* Need to leverage energy better into and up plant leg
* Pretty good left bicep contraction at release (glove tuck)

### Alex Timp
Arsenal: 2-Seam, Slider, Changeup

MLB Comparables:

* Fastball
  + [Felix Hernandez](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/felix-hernandez-433587?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) (Changeup) - King Felix made a hall of fame career running his changeup down and in on righties. He relied on the movement, not the velo difference from his fastball. His struggles have come with a 4-5 mph decrease in velo and much worse command. 
  
  + [Ariel Jurado](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/ariel-jurado-642558?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) (Sinker) - Hit hard in 2019, especially against lefties. 
  
  + [Mike Leake](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/mike-leake-502190?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) (Sinker) - More of a 3/4 release, but still keeps shoulders upright. 
  
* Changeup
  + [Mike Morin](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/mike-morin-573046?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) - Very slow (72-73 mph). Could be an idea for lefties. Hitters had a .133 BA against Morin's changeup - a 19 mph difference from his fastball. Creating more than a 5 mph differential will help your fastball play up.
  
  ![**Mike Morin - 2019 Arsenal**](Morin2019.png)
  
* Slider
  + [Matt Barnes](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/savant-player/matt-barnes-598264?stats=statcast-r-pitching-mlb) (Curveball) - Interesting, he started throwing it 50% of the time and it maintained its success (.171 xBA). 
  
Mechanical Keys:

* Prevent upper body lean during hip break
* Need more hip-to-shoulder separation - Currently almost even
* Front leg comes to early and drifts - lead with the front hip
* Front foot opening too soon
* Closed-off landing
* Good shin angle
* Good job of leveraging energy at release point - stiff front leg
* Good 45 degree angle at hand separation
